## The American Chestnut {#theamericanchestnut}

The American Chestnut was the apex tree of the Eastern hardwood forest. It has been said that a squirrel could travel from Georgia to Maine jumping from tree top to tree top just on American Chestnut trees!

This magnificent tree has been reduced to an understory tree by a microscopic foe called the chestnut blight fungus that was brought over to the United States in the early 1900s from Asia. The original tree could grow well over one hundred feet tall with a trunk diameter of five feet or more. The wood split easily with a density of grain to yield a high energy output when burned along with a beautiful deep grain for woodworking. Uses for the wood were as diverse as barn lumber, split rail fencing, and furniture making. It was always said that a chestnut tree could carry a man from the cradle to the grave. The wood was not the only value-driven part of this special tree, the other half of the story was its fruit.

The chestnut itself sustained enormous amounts of life.  There is really no calculation of the damage incurred by the loss of this tree. Wildlife, such as a number of voles, went extinct from the loss. What else? What about certain bird species or other mammals? Billions of insects visited the flowers each year, how did it affect them? It just simply is not known. 

The nut itself is very different than other tree nuts in its composition. It is not an oily nut, but instead dries hard like a grain and can subsequently be stored for years. This enables the nut itself to be used very differently than other nuts. It can be ground into flour to be used in cookies, cakes, pies, or dressing -- really anything that uses flour. The nut can be roasted, boiled, boiled and pureed into a cream, and even turned into a luxurious candy the Europeans call a "Marron glac√©." The chestnut tree is a very dependable producer and very versatile for human consumption. These silent losses are going on even today (Eastern Hemlock, Dogwood, and Hellbender are a few of examples), and have an enormous impact on our environment. I have shed tears over the 300-year-old Hemlocks in the rich, fertile valleys of the Appalacian Mountains, just wondering what was going to feed and protect the Grouse during the heavy snow. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have a voice.

## Breeding {#breeding}

### Our Breeding Program

We have  been in the business of breeding and working with the American Chestnut for over twenty years. These trees originated from around Bowling Green, Kentucky. They sprouted from old stump sprouts in an area that was logged around thirty years ago.  Once the forest floor was opened the sprouts grew vigorously into fairly large trees. Several are still growing and surviving a serious onslaught of the blight fungus among tough competition with some yellow-poplar trees. Our hand-selected third generation trees from the original forest trees are now starting to produce flowers and burrs. We are excited about the potential of blight resistance showing up.

We also have some high-elevation trees within our breeding program, which originated from over five thousand feet in elevation! These trees have some unique qualities that caught my attention such as a large fruit (nut) with a very fast maturation time. This could potentially be a great northern chestnut for areas like Minnesota and potentially into Canada. The large nut size and high carbohydrate content would make an exceptional commercial tree. Make sure and check out some of the images of these trees; some of the leaves are over fifteen inches in length!

## Our Southern KY Orchard {#southernkyorchard}

Watch our video below describing some of our projects with different variants of the American Chestnut. We have worked hard establishing several orchards in Southern Kentucky. The orchard on the video is around 10 years old. Some of the trees are showing variable resistance to the chestnut blight. These trees preserve genetics for several regions in the US and are quite valuable for that purpose. Enjoy!
