This is a collection of some personal projects I've worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

## Miscellaneous

- Organizer of the [Toronto R Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Greater-Toronto-Area-GTA-R-Users-Group/).

- **[Impact Replays](https://daattali.com/shiny/cfl/)** - I participated in a national hackathon (SportsHack15) and won 3rd place with this app. We had to build something that would increase engagement of CFL (Canadian Football League) fans. This app uses play-by-play data from games to let you focus on just the action moments of games.

- **[Settlers of Catan Turn Analyzer](https://deanattali.com/settlers-catan-turn-analyzer/)** - You really think that 4 came up more than the 8? Tired of everyone "wrongly" claiming you take the longest turns? Only one way to find out!

- **[Minesweeper](/files/Minesweeper)** - tiny Minesweeper game I built as part of the interview process with Airbnb.  It's not fancy at all, but it's the best I could do in the two hours they allotted me back in the day.

- **[Building your own portable oldies gaming console](https://github.com/daattali/rasperry-pi-gaming-console-setup)** - I bought a raspberry pi and turned it into an awesome portable gaming console that supports SNES/PS1/GameGear/GameBoy.  Super cool.
