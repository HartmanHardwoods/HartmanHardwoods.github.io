## The American Chestnut {#theamericanchestnut}

The American Chestnut was once the crown jewel of the Eastern hardwood forest. It was so dominant that people used to say a squirrel could travel from Georgia to Maine by leaping from chestnut tree to chestnut tree without ever touching the ground.

This towering giant, which could grow over a hundred feet tall with trunks five feet thick, was tragically brought low by a microscopic invader: the chestnut blight fungus, accidentally introduced from Asia in the early 1900s. Once a forest canopy titan, the American Chestnut now survives only as an understory tree.

Its wood was prized not only for its beauty -- marked by a deep, elegant grain -- but also for its utility. It split easily and burned hot, making it ideal for firewood. It was used in everything from barns and fences to fine furniture. The old saying goes, a chestnut tree could carry a person "from the cradle to the grave." But the tree's value extended far beyond its wood.

Its fruit, the chestnut, sustained an incredible range of life. The true cost of its loss is impossible to measure. Some wildlife, like certain voles, vanished entirely. What other species -- birds, mammals, insects -- suffered in silence? Billions of insects once visited its flowers each year, and the ripple effects of their absence remain unknown.

Unlike most tree nuts, the chestnut isn’t oily. Instead, it dries firm like a grain, making it ideal for long-term storage. This unique quality also opens up a world of culinary uses -- it can be ground into flour for baked goods, roasted, boiled, pureed into creamy dishes, or transformed into luxurious European confections like <em>marrons glacés</em>. Chestnut trees were not only prolific producers but also invaluable food sources.

Sadly, the American Chestnut’s story is not unique. Other silent losses are occurring even now: the Eastern Hemlock, Flowering Dogwood, and the Hellbender salamander among them. These changes have profound environmental consequences. I’ve wept at the sight of ancient Hemlocks -- some over 300 years old -- dying in the lush valleys of the Appalachian Mountains, wondering what will shelter or feed the Ruffed Grouse when the deep snows come.

These trees can’t speak for themselves -- but we can.

## Breeding {#breeding}

### Our Breeding Program

We have  been in the business of breeding and working with the American Chestnut for over twenty years. These trees originated from around Bowling Green, Kentucky. They sprouted from old stump sprouts in an area that was logged around thirty years ago.  Once the forest floor was opened the sprouts grew vigorously into fairly large trees. Several are still growing and surviving a serious onslaught of the blight fungus among tough competition with some yellow-poplar trees. Our hand-selected third generation trees from the original forest trees are now starting to produce flowers and burrs. We are excited about the potential of blight resistance showing up.

We also have some high-elevation trees within our breeding program, which originated from over five thousand feet in elevation! These trees have some unique qualities that caught my attention such as a large fruit (nut) with a very fast maturation time. This could potentially be a great northern chestnut for areas like Minnesota and potentially into Canada. The large nut size and high carbohydrate content would make an exceptional commercial tree. Make sure and check out some of the images of these trees; some of the leaves are over fifteen inches in length!

## Our Southern KY Orchard {#southernkyorchard}

Watch our video below describing some of our projects with different variants of the American Chestnut. We have worked hard establishing several orchards in Southern Kentucky. The orchard on the video is around 10 years old. Some of the trees are showing variable resistance to the chestnut blight. These trees preserve genetics for several regions in the US and are quite valuable for that purpose. Enjoy!
